# Getting Started

The number one thing we want to do after we get our hands on LimePi **Zero** is to boot it and have our simple "hello world" program run over it via SSH through serial port (sound techie enough right! ðŸ˜Ž). But hold on, we are far from that point yet. 


## First Things First

Our journey includes four MileStones:

- [`Building linux for LimePi`](https://www.example.com)
- [`Writing our linux image to board`](https://www.example.com)
- [`Login Via SSH through serial port`](https://www.example.com)
- [`Run our favourite Hello World program`](https://www.example.com)
